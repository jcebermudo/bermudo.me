Growing up, I always felt like I didn’t belong anywhere. Whenever a grown-up asked me, 'What do you want to be when you grow up?' there wasn’t always a clear answer, while the other kids already had a vision carved out for them. I never saw myself as a doctor, lawyer, industrial engineer, or any of the conventional paths a typical Filipino kid would usually take. I felt like a clueless misfit destined to fail. Despite this constant existential dread, I still did well in school. But I felt like a soulless machine. I would study hard, listen to my teachers, follow the rules, and get the highest grades possible. I thought that by doing so, the career path I would take in the future would automatically open its doors to me, as long as I had high grades.

But I began to realize in my junior high school years that it’s utter bullshit. The social expectations that I had been respecting for years were something I began to hate and been itching to break. During this period of realization, I discovered coding and graphic design. Its unconventional nature felt like it was made for me. I also needed money to buy new computer parts so I made my first dollar on the internet by making designs for a small YouTuber. I went into various online and gaming communities to sell my design and development services. I always thought that this period would eventually come to an end and pursue a path that is deemed to be 'safe.'

However, one night as I was scrolling through Twitter, I came across one of Paul Graham’s essays, 'Why Nerds are Unpopular,' which introduced me to the world of startups. Just the thought of being able to build anything I want and having people use it excites me. And so I took designing and programming more seriously. After classes, I’d jump straight into Discord calls with some internet friends, pull all-nighters, and work on side projects. It got to the point where I applied to VCs and accelerators. Though none of my projects went through, these were periods that gave me the most excitement.

These experiences alone led me to want to work on startups for the next decade or two of my life. I don’t think I’ll ever fit in anywhere, but that’s okay; being able to work on unconventional things that could possibly push civilization forward is far more important to me.
