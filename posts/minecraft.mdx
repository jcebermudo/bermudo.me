It was 2019, and I had to figure out how to make money to buy myself a new computer. I was already designing and doing work for other people but it wasn't enough and I have yet to grasp the concept of freelancing. This changed when my friend introduced me to a website where you can hire designers and developers for your Minecraft server. I was also heavily obsessed with Minecraft and what better way to combine my favorite game with what I am passionate about.

The website is called <a href="https://www.mc-market.org/" target="_blank">MC Market</a> and it's still up as I'm writing this. It's a website filled with teenagers trying to make money off Minecraft. This could be in the form of video editing, graphic design, motion design, system administration, plugin development, and many more.

I took on all kinds of roles during my time at that website. And it gave me so many ideas and concepts about what I could be doing. It made me even more passionate about design and programming. I made server trailers, logos, built websites, worked with Tebex/XenForo themes, and even worked with some big YouTubers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Spifey" target="_blank">Spifey</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BionicDanny" target="_blank">Bionic</a>. I also met and discovered so many
talented people that would eventually be startup founders, product designers, successful content creators, and cinematographers.

Although these things were great, the community was very toxic. You can't charge more than $15 for a logo or else you will be called out as a scammer or a _bad designer_. So after a year of freelancing there, I moved out and decided to work on even bigger projects like working with studios and startups.

We all had to start somewhere, whether it was to crack Adobe Photoshop when you were 12 or your gaming clan needed a logo and banner. I just wrote this to share how I got started with my design journey.
