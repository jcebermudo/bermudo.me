I still can’t figure out my life. It’s still a blurry mess. And I doubt that I will fully figure it out. But that doesn’t stop me from doing the things I love and what I want to achieve."

I just turned 16! So I guess this is the best time for me to contemplate. Over the year, I met a lot of talented people, my skills improved, and I got to take care of my overall health. I still can’t figure out my life. It’s still a blurry mess. And I doubt that I will fully figure it out. But that doesn’t stop me from doing the things I love and what I want to achieve.

Here are some goals I’ll try achieving at 16:

- Write 2 times a month
- Finish 1 book per month
- Hit my new milestone in my total earnings in freelancing
- Fill my design portfolio with 5 projects
- Ship at least 3 products
- Finally use TypeScript in my projects
- Exercise everyday

I don’t want to go too overboard with my goals otherwise I’ll end up feeling shitty about myself when I look back. These are just goals I see as realistic to do within a year. I’ll also be doing these types of posts every time it’s my birthday.
