As 2023 starts to sink in, I’ve been planning on doing a long-term software side project this year, just one that I can fully focus on. But to find the idea for that project, I listed down my requirements. It has to be something I would personally use and one that many would benefit from. I came up with <a href="https://alan.so" target="_blank">Alan</a>, an AI copywriter for generating meaningful and SEO-friendly articles for your startup.

Articles and written content are great ways to market your startup and generate more users. By streamlining the writing process, founders will save more time and money and put more energy into building the best product. With Alan’s simple UI and basic questions, you’ll be able to immediately create high-quality blog posts.

The problem with the current AI copywriters is that it’s too sophisticated. You get too many options and it’s hard to navigate causing too much friction. What if we can change that? Alan will make it feel like you’re the one writing the article and the AI will just boost the process giving you a similar experience with Substack and Medium.

I’m still talking to more users and building out the MVP! For now, you can sign up for <a href="https://alan.so" target="_blank">early access</a> once we launch our beta!
