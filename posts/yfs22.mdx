It was difficult for me to find people at school who were passionate about design, programming, startups, or even just technology, so I had to resort to meeting people outside of school through Twitter, LinkedIn, and cold emailing. This is how I met my friends and co-founders, and Xyrelle Supremo, and got the opportunity to pitch our startup at the Young Founders Summit 2022 in Singapore. The YFS was a life-changing experience for me. Not only did I get to pitch in front of investors and founders and receive funding, but more importantly, I got to meet some of the smartest and most driven people in the world who are as obsessed with building meaningful projects as I am. To top it off, I even got to fulfill a childhood dream by visiting one of Google's offices."

There I was, a 16-year-old kid tinkering with computers and reading Paul Graham's essays on startups. It was difficult for me to find people at school who were passionate about design, programming, startups, or even just technology, so I had to resort to meeting people outside of school through Twitter, LinkedIn, and cold emailing. This is how I met my friends and co-founders, <a href="https://www.aldrichalvarez.com/" target="_blank">Aldrich Alvarez</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/xyrelle-supremo-6b9797218/" target="_blank">Xyrelle Supremo</a>, and got the opportunity to pitch our startup at the Young Founders Summit 2022 in Singapore. The YFS was a life-changing experience for me. Not only did I get to pitch in front of investors and founders and receive funding, but more importantly, I got to meet some of the smartest and most driven people in the world who are as obsessed with building meaningful projects as I am. To top it off, I even got to fulfill a childhood dream by visiting one of Google's offices.

To provide context, the <a href="https://www.smarterme.sg/yfs" target="_blank">Young Founders Summit</a> is an annual program co-founded by <a href="https://sg.linkedin.com/in/ee-ling-lim?original_referer=" target="_blank">Ee Ling Lim</a> that allows Gen Zs from around the world to pitch in front of investors, receive grant funding, and build a network of talented people in the tech industry. This year, the event was sponsored by <a href="https://madangels.xyz/" target="_blank">MAD Angels</a>, a DAO/community-owned startup accelerator.

Our startup is called Hypershelter. We build solar-powered tents for displaced typhoon victims in the Philippines. We had about two months to prepare our prototypes and pitch deck before Demo Day. Aldrich, Xy, and I spent sleepless nights doing prototypes, market research, validation, and interviewing beneficiaries and organizations. We were interviewed by the local news and wrote an article about us. We also received mentorship from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jochen-lorenz-7626951/" target="_blank">Jochen Lorenz</a> at Bosch, who helped us tremendously to prepare for Demo Day. Fortunately, after all of that, we got 1st runner-up and received $1,500 USD in funding to build our prototype.

But the YFS was about so much more than just pitching our startup. It was also a valuable network of talented people from around the world. The other founders who participated in the event were nothing short of amazing, coming from countries such as Romania, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore and working on projects ranging from apps for EV charging stations to water-saving hardware solutions, eco-friendly air purifiers, and sustainable tourism apps. After Demo Day, we all gathered for dinner to celebrate and get to know one another, discussing our schools and future plans. I have to admit, these founders were far more driven, intelligent, and obsessed with their work than I am. They came from diverse backgrounds – one had an internship at a big company, while another had a specialized research background. In addition to that, I also had the chance to talk to VCs and individuals with decades of experience in tech, who gave me valuable advice on my startup and future career.

Overall, participating in the YFS was an unforgettable experience for me, allowing me to immerse myself in a new environment (it was also my first time traveling to another country). As I look back on the event, I realize just how much control I have over my own life and how many amazing opportunities the world has to offer. I can achieve so much more if I just push myself out of my comfort zone, whether that's building a startup, writing an essay, or reaching out to my favorite engineer or founder.

_A small note to the people from YFS ‘22:_

_I wish you the best in the future and I hope I could meet you all again! (possibly next year’s YFS)_
