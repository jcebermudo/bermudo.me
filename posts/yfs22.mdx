There I was, a 16-year-old kid tinkering with computers and reading Paul Graham's essays on startups. It was difficult for me to find people at school who were passionate about design, programming, startups, or even just technology, so I had to resort to meeting people outside of school through Twitter, LinkedIn, and cold emailing. This is how I met my friends and co-founders, Aldrich Alvarez and Xyrelle Supremo, and got the opportunity to pitch our startup at the Young Founders Summit 2022 in Singapore. The YFS was a life-changing experience for me. Not only did I get to pitch in front of investors and founders and receive funding, but more importantly, I got to meet some of the smartest and most driven people in the world who are as obsessed with building meaningful projects as I am. On top of that, I also got the opportunity to fulfill my childhood dream of visiting one of Google's offices.

To provide context, the Young Founders Summit is an annual program co-founded by Ee Ling Lim that allows Gen Zs from around the world to pitch in front of investors, receive grant funding, and build a network of talented people in the tech industry. This year, the event was sponsored by MAD Angels, a DAO/community-owned startup accelerator.

Our startup is called Hypershelter. We build solar-powered tents for displaced typhoon victims in the Philippines. We had about two months to prepare our prototypes and pitch deck before Demo Day. Me, Aldrich, and Xy spent sleepless nights doing prototypes, market research, validation, and interviewing beneficiaries and organizations. We were interviewed by the local news and wrote an article about us. We also received mentorship from Jochen Lorenz at Bosch, who helped us tremendously to prepare for Demo Day. Fortunately, after all of that, we came in the top two and received $1,500 USD in funding to build our prototype.

But, of course, YFS is not just about pitching your startup. It's also a valuable network of talented people from around the world. The people who joined were nothing short of amazing. I saw founders my age from Romania, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore building an app for EV charging stations, a water-saving hardware solution, eco-friendly air purifiers, a sustainable tourism app, and much more. After Demo Day, we gathered for dinner to celebrate and got to know more about each other – what schools we go to and what our plans for the future are. I must admit that they are far more driven, intelligent, and obsessed with their work than I am. They came from diverse backgrounds – one had an internship at a big company and one had a specialized research background. In addition to that, I also had the opportunity to talk to VCs and people who had decades of experience in tech, who gave me advice on my startup and my future career.

It was an unforgettable experience for me to immerse myself in a new environment (considering that it was also my first time going to another country). As I reflect on my experience, I realized how much control I have over my life and how vast this world is, filled with amazing opportunities and opportunities for learning. I can achieve more if I just force myself to step out of my comfort zone, whether it's building a startup, writing an essay, or reaching out to my favorite engineer or founder.
